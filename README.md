Try the app [here](https://kelly-jammming.netlify.app/)

## Project Purpose
This app allows you to search for songs from Spotify and create a new playlist.
With each search, you can add the songs of your choosing to your playlist on the righthand column.
You can name your playlist whatever you want and remove songs if you change your mind.
Once you're satisfied with your playlist, you can click the 'Save to Spotify' button, and the playlist will be saved to your account, allowing you to listen on any device where you have Spotify!

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JSX
- React
- APIs (HTTP requests and responses, authentication)

## Features
- Users can search for songs by song title.
- Users can see the song title, artist, and album for each song.
- Users can create a custom playlist and export it to their personal Spotify account.
- Users can see who is logged in at the top right corner. (Log out does not actually log the user out, but once the user searches for a track, their profile will be populated).

## Future Work
- Integrate a log out feature so multiple users can use the app.
- Add media queries for use on smaller screens (currently works best on desktop).
- Improve responsive design.
- Add more search options
- Add more information about each song
