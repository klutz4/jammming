# Jammming Playlist App

## Project Purpose
This app allows you to search for songs from Spotify and create a new playlist.
With each search, you can add the songs of your choosing to your playlist on the righthand column.
You can name your playlist whatever you want and remove songs if you change your mind.
Once you're satisfied with your playlist, you can click the 'Save to Spotify' button, and the playlist will be saved to your account, allowing you to listen on any device where you have Spotify!
